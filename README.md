### Purpose
This project takes bike data from CitiBike, an emerging bike sharing service in New York, and visualizes findings into a Tableau presentation. The client is optimistic that analysis of a month of bike data will provide insight into potential outcomes of future expansion into other cities, starting with Des Moines.

### Resources
**Data Source:** [Citi Bike Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) for August 2019
**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public 2022.2
